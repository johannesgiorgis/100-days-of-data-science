# 100 Days Of Data Science - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday, March 20th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked through _Chi-squared tests_ and _Multi category chi-squared tests_ missions within DataQuest's Data Scientist _Probability and Statistics_ step.

**Thoughts**: After working through implementing the chi-square by hand (not necessarily the most complicated), I was provided with the correct function to use [`scipy.stats.chisquare`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mstats.chisquare.html). This reminded me of a statement I keep hearing repeatedly - we don't necessarily need to know the full details of the various algorithms to use them thanks to libraries like `scipy` - we just need to know WHEN and HOW to use them correctly.

**Link(s) to work**: No links. But will be starting on a guided project tomorrow which will utilize my learnings from today.
